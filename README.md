# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Challenge

This repository contains code, models, and resources for predicting customer churn in a bank using various machine learning algorithms. The project is organized for a Kaggle challenge and includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and submission scripts.

## Project Structure

- `bank-customer-churn-prediction-challenge/` - Contains the training and test datasets.
- `feature_columns/` - Stores feature column information.
- `html/` - Visualizations and model summaries in HTML format.
- `imputer/` - Pre-trained imputer for missing values.
- `models/` - Saved machine learning models (ANN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for model development and analysis.
- `scaler/` - Pre-trained scaler for feature normalization.
- `scores/` - Model performance scores.
- `submissions/` - Submission files for Kaggle.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasithaPerera2002/bank-customer-churn.git
   ```
2. Install required Python packages (see notebooks for dependencies).
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for model training and evaluation.
4. Use the provided models and scripts to generate predictions and submissions.
